# Project Description

The "Employee Polls" project is my implementation of the final project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It is a web application that allows employees to participate in polls and surveys related to their work. Employees can create their own polls, respond to polls created by other employees, and view the results of polls. This project is built using React, Redux, and React Router, and the UI is styled using the Tailwind CSS framework.
